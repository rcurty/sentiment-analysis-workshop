## Ways we can help you

[Research Data Services (RDS)](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/research-data-services){target='_blank'} helps UCSB researchers manage and preserve their research data in a more effective and reproducible way through:

-   Consultations
-   Long-term engagements
-   Instructional workshops.

Our team offers support across the research data lifecycle, from pre-project planning to post-project archival, connecting researchers with both locally- and externally-provided resources, data management systems and curation services. Our goal is to ensure that all research data is well-described, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), as well as sustainable and preservable, and that researchers receive scholarly credit for sharing and publishing their data.

We recommend you explore the **Research Computing and Data** website ([https://rcd.ucsb.edu](https://rcd.ucsb.edu){target='_blank'} ) maintained by our department for campus-wide tools, recommendations, events, communities and learning resources.
