## What is Sentiment Analysis?

As social beings, our beliefs, understanding of reality, and everyday decisions are deeply shaped by the opinions, perceptions and evaluations of others. This social conditioning is a well-documented phenomenon in fields such as psychology, sociology, and communication, where it is understood that individuals often rely on external cues, especially the attitudes and judgments of others when forming their own assessments.

Understanding how public reaction and sentiment shapes and reflects collective perception has become central not only to corporate strategy, but also to scientific inquiry across many academic disciplines.

While the analysis of public opinion predates the Internet, the modern field of sentiment analysis did not gain momentum until the mid-2000s. This surge was largely driven by the rise of Web 2.0, which leveraged the internet into a more participatory platform, enabling users to create, share, and comment on content across chats, blogs, forums, and other social media. These digital spaces dramatically expanded the circulation and accessibility of user-generated content, creating a fertile ground for computational approaches to analyze subjective expressions in large volumes of text. But what is sentiment analysis?

*Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is now a well-established area of study within natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics. It focuses on identifying and extracting peopleâ€™s opinions, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from written language.*

Whether through product reviews, political commentary, or social media posts in virtually any possible topic of interest, sentiment analysis aims to quantify and interpret subjective information at scale, enabling applications in marketing, social science, finance, and beyond. In this course, we will explore ways of extracting insights from textual data, in particular how we can detect underlying emotions within messages shared by people on a popular streaming TV series.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

-   Explain the fundamental principles and real-world applications of sentiment analysis.

-   Apply essential text pre-processing techniques (e.g, cleaning, stopwords removal, lemmatization, tokenization, tf-idf) to reduce noise and prepare textual data for sentiment analysis.

-   Perform sentiment analysis in R using both polarity-based and more fine-grained emotion extraction methods.

-   Visualize the data to extract insights.
