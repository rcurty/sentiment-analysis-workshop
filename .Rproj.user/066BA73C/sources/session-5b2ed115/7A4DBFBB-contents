Also known as word reduction, lemmatization is the process of transforming words into their base or dictionary form (*lemma*) to identify similarities in meaning and usage across different contexts. Take the word "run" as an example. It can appear in various forms like "ran", "runs", "running", and "runner". But the variations don’t stop there, as it includes complex forms like "outrun", "overrun", or "underrun". These variations make it challenging for computers to process natural language effectively unless they can recognize that these words are related. That’s where lemmatization comes in; it helps machines group related words together by reducing them to a common root present in the dictionary, enabling better understanding and analysis of text.

You might be asking yourself: Wait...but what about "stemming"? Stemming is considered a more straightforward but agressive process that removes prefixes and suffices, reducing the word to its roots. It is considered a less effective approach compared to lemmatization because it may can occasionally lead to meaningless words. For example, while "ran" and "runs" would be stemmed to "run", for running would end up as "runn". For this reason, we will stick with lemmatization and skip stemming in our data analysis. However, depending on your computing capability to process large volumes of textual data, you might consider using it, giving that stemming, since it is considered a more efficient approach.

An important thing to consider is that we look into words as separate units (tokens) as we saw in the previous episode. For example, think about the word "leaves". That could both represent the plural of the noun "leaf" or the verb in third person for the word "leave". That is a good reminder of always remember to apply part of speech (POS) because lemmatization algorithms utilize a lexicon with linguistic rules based on pre-determined tags to avoid misinterpretation.
