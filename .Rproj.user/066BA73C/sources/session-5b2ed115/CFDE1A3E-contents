title: "Basic Polarity"
---

Now that we have completed all the key preprocessing steps and our example dataset is in much better shape, we can finally proceed with sentiment analysis.

This will be a two-step approach, where we will start with the basic polarity and then, advance to a more fine-grained analysis, exploring different emotional expressions within text.

## Basic Polarity

Polarity classification is a fundamental aspect of sentiment analysis to measure the overall emotional tone expressed in text data which can be categorized as positive, neutral or negative.

Most models assign "sentiment scores" with values ranging from -1 to +1 to represent the intensity of the sentiment, being scores closer to -1 considered negative, those closer to 0 neutral and +1 positive.

We will be using the package `sentimentr` ([more info](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sentimentr/sentimentr.pdf)) to compute polarity classification and attribute sentiment scores to the posts included in our dataset. We chose this package due to its capability of handling negation (when negators appear nearby) and adjust to adverbs' magnitude also known as valence shifters, which are adverbs and words that modify the intensity or direction of sentiment. These include amplifiers (e.g., very, really, absolutely, totally), de-amplifiers or downtoners (e.g., barely, hardly, rarely, ), as well as adversative conjunctions (e.g., but, yet, however, although).

For example, this package is capable of
