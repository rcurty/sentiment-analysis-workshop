After all, producers may also be watching the publicâ€™s reaction on social media to decide whether a second season is worth pursuing.

The data we pulled for this exercise comes from real social media posts, meaning they are inherently messy, and we know that even before going in. Because it is derived from natural language, this kind of data is unstructured, often filled with inconsistencies and irregularities.

Before we can apply any meaningful analysis or modeling, itâ€™s crucial to visually inspect the data to get a sense of what weâ€™re working with. Eyeballing the raw text helps us identify common patterns, potential noise, and areas that will require careful preprocessing to ensure the downstream tasks are effective and reliable.

It is time to open RStudio and our example! The folder you have saved contains a quarto document (.qmd) which will serve as our workshop workbook. In this document we will include the R code and comments related to the content we will explore. Let's have that open in RStudio.

Let's install the required packages (via the console) and load them. Next, let's inspect the `comments.csv` file and take a quick look at it!

``` r
# Inspecting the data

comments <- read_csv("comments.csv")
head(comments$text)
```

# ðŸ’¬ Discussion

Working in pairs or trios, look briefly at the data and discuss the challenges that may arise when attempting to analyze this dataset on its current form. What could be potential areas of friction that could compromise the results?
